## MultiAgent Systems (Self-Interested agents)
### 3 players Infinite Prisoner’s Dilemma (3p-IPD) game
> - For the 3 players Prisoner’s Dilemma game (3p-PD), the dominant defection strategy relies on the fact that it is a one shot game with no future.

> - On the other hand, for the 3 players Infinite Prisoner’s Dilemma game (3p-IPD) whereby the three players may meet each other again.  This encourages the players to develop strategies based on the previous game interactions.  Thus, a player’s current move may affect how his/her opponents behave in the future and affect the player’s future payoffs.

> - This apparently helps to remove the single dominant strategy of defection because the players can use more complex strategies dependent on game history to maximise the payoffs they will receive.

> - The players Pay-offs matrix is :
